# What is this?
This repository is YM2413 + PSG version of YS2 songs created with MSGDRV. 

The files can be played on the real YM2413 chip, or VGMPlay with emu2413 >= 1.5 or NukedOPLL >= 1.0.
At this moment (Mar 2020), the most MSX emulators cannot play the files correctly because they have not employed the latest YM2413 engine.
